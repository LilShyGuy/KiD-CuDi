        <p>Kid Cudi his real name is <em>Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi</em>.
            Scott was born on the 30th of januari 1984 in Cleveland, Ohio the united states.
            Kid Cudi gained a lot of his following with his release of his mixtape called "A Kid Named Cudi".
            This mixtape got to the likes of people like Ye formally known as Kanye West which let him get signed
            under Ye's record label G.O.O.D Music in late 2008. This also started an close friendship with his then mentor Ye.
            Now however they haven't been close since the break-up of Ye and Kim Kardashian as Kim than started dating Pete Davidson
            an close friend of Cudi who introduced the two of them. Which led up to Ye believing Cudi was the cause of Kim not wanting
            to get back.

            Cudi has eight studio albums under his belt as of 2022. His breakthrough single "Day 'n' Nite," which reached the top five of
            the Billboard charts in 2008, catapulted him to fame. Man on the Moon: The End of Day, Cudi's first studio album, was released
            in 2009 and was awarded a gold certification by the RIAA. He followed up Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager with the
            singles "Erase Me" and "Mr. Rager" in 2010. Later that year, Cudi and his longtime partner Dot da Genius created the rock group
            WZRD. The group released one self-titled album in early 2012. Cudi released Indicud in April 2013, and it quickly rose to the top
            of numerous charts.Cudi's fourth album, Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon, was unexpectedly released in February 2014,
            exclusively to digital retailers with no advertising. Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven, his experimental fifth studio album, was released 
            in December 2015 to a negative to mixed response from critics. With the December 2016 release of his sixth studio album Passion, 
            Pain & Demon Slayin', he returned to his distinctive sound. Cudi fans were rewarded to a long-awaited collaborative album with Kanye 
            West in June 2018, when the two launched a fresh new hip-hop super-duo known as KIDS SEE GHOSTS and released their debut self-titled 
            album on Kanye West's 41st birthday. After waiting a full ten years since the release of its predecessor, Man On The Moon III: The 
            Chosen was finally available to Kid Cudi fans in December 2020. It debuted at No. 2 on Billboard's all-genre 200 chart and No. 1 on 
            Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, becoming his third album to do so. The album garnered excellent reviews from both critics 
            and fans, proving Cudi's ongoing relevance throughout his career. The eighth studio album by Cudi, Entergalactic, was finally released 
            in 2022 after much anticipation. For Cudi, creating an animated Netflix special to promote the album's release was a change of pace for 
            Entergalactic.It was voiced by himself, Jessica Williams, Ty Dolla $ign, Timothee Chalamet, Laura Harrier, Vanessa Hudgens, Macaulay 
            Culkin, Jaden Smith, 070 Shake, and Keith David, among others. The animation styles changed frequently, and the music was thoughtfully 
            incorporated into this highly ambitious animated movie. Do What I Want and Willing To Trust, both featuring Ty Dolla $ign, were released 
            as singles in support of the album. The actual album was released on September 30th, the same day the animated special premiered, to 
            generally negative reviews, with many claiming it couldn't stand on its own without the special supporting it.

            As of October 2022, Kid Cudi has made hints that he will be leaving the music industry or, more accurately, retiring from it. He claimed 
            he has been artistically dry and wants to adopt a fresh approach to his creative career because he has recently become more involved in 
            television and movies, acting more frequently, and making his directing debut sometime in the future. This hinted at the possibility that 
            KIDS SEE GHOSTS 2 will never be completed because Kid Cudi and Kanye's conflict has escalated since it began in 2021. Entergalactic was 
            criticized by millions of fans who thought it was a poor choice for him to end his career on, but Cudi did not totally rule out the 
            possibility of returning to the music industry, so there is a chance that this won't be his last project.

            Kid Cudi has sold over 5.2 million digital singles and worked with many prominent artists in the music industry. Due to his creativity and 
            conveyed emotions, Cudi has amassed a large cult-like following among high school and college students and stoners.
